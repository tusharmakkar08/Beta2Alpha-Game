Mastermind game made in assembly language using TASM.
The code is well commented.
It is implemented by interfacing it with a circuit made up of LED's and switches used for taking input and LED's for showing output as Alpha and Beta.
Microprocessor used : 8086,8255(for interfacing)
Mastermind.asm - Simple code in asm (Shows output on Computer Screen)
B2A.asm - Interfaced code with 8255 ( Shows output through LED )

To run the file use :
1> tasm mastermind.asm
